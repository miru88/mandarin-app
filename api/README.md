Project Idea: Make application to take words that I know and make stories with chatgpt

### 1. API Design & Routing (REST or GraphQL)
- Expose endpoints for:
  - Uploading word lists.
  - Generating new stories based on a list.
  - Fetching past stories with filtering (e.g., difficulty level, grammar points).
  - Viewing word frequency statistics.

  - there already exists a table with words, create the entities required for typeorm for the words




### 2. Middleware & Authentication
- Use NestJS middleware to:
  - Log requests.
  - Validate inputs (e.g., ensure uploaded word lists are properly formatted).
  - Enforce authentication (e.g., API keys or JWT if you plan to have users).

### 3. Database Design & Query Optimization
- Store stories along with:
  - Words used.
  - Grammar points covered.
  - Difficulty estimation.
  - Date created.
- Use PostgreSQL with TypeORM to manage relationships (e.g., many-to-many for words and stories).
- Index frequently queried data (e.g., words that appear most often in stories).

### 4. Background Processing (BullMQ)
- Queue up story generation jobs asynchronously.
- Allow prioritization of certain requests (e.g., long-form stories vs. short ones).
- Process stories in batches to avoid rate limits.

### 5. Caching & Performance
- Cache frequently used word lists and stories using Redis.
- Implement pagination for retrieving large sets of stored stories.

### 6. Testing & CI/CD
- Write unit tests for services (e.g., story generation logic, database queries).
- Use integration tests to ensure the API functions correctly.
- Set up automated deployment with GitHub Actions.

### 7. AI Integration (OpenAI API)
- Craft structured prompts to guide ChatGPT to generate stories that:
  - Use specific words.
  - Cover certain grammar points.
  - Match a difficulty level.

### 8. WebSockets for Real-Time Updates
- Enable real-time updates when stories are being generated.
- Example use case:
  - A front-end client connects to a WebSocket server.
  - When a story generation job is queued, the server sends progress updates.

### 9. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and User Management
- Implement user authentication (JWT, OAuth).
- Create roles (e.g., basic user vs. admin).
- Define permissions (e.g., who can edit stored stories?).

### 10. Multi-Tenancy & User-Specific Data Storage
- Handle isolated word lists and story histories per user.
- Support tenant-specific configurations (e.g., preferred grammar points).
